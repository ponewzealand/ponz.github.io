## Abstract

The team at Oceanum have created a powerful environmental data science platform that accelerates work flows across various disciplines, from oceanography and coastal ecology to climate change adaptation. The [OCEANUM.IO](https://oceanum.io) platform streamlines data discovery, access, and wrangling for all levels of expertise, overcoming many of the limitations and points of friction in existing data infrastructures. By addressing issues like file format incompatibilities and data volumes, [OCEANUM.IO](https://oceanum.io) enables users to focus on their analysis tasks rather than the underlying data engineering - thereby promoting more effective use of their time. With more than 5000 national and international datasets already registered, and the ability for users to upload their own data, the cloud-based application is actively promoting data democratisation and reducing knowledge disparities.
